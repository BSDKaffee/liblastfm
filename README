Development
===========
Public Headers
--------------
1. Header guards should be prefixed with LASTFM, eg. LASTFM_WS_REPLY_H
2. #includes should be to the system path eg. #include <lastfm/Scrobbler>
3. Don't make a header public unless it is absolutely required!
4. To make the header public edit the headers.files line in the pro file

Private Headers
---------------
1. For consistency and to make it more obvious it is a private header, don't
   prefix the header guard with LASTFM
2. #includes should be the full source tree path, eg.
   #include "../ws/WsReply.h"
