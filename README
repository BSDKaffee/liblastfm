liblastfm
=========
liblastfm is a collection of libraries to help you integrate Last.fm services 
into your rich desktop software. It depends on Qt 4.4.

Dependencies
============
The build process requires ruby, perl and GNU make. Pls to remove perl dep.
Pls to fork http://github.com/mxcl/liblastfm

Mac OS X
--------
	sudo port selfupdate
	sudo port upgrade installed
	sudo port install libsamplerate fftw-3 libmad qt4-mac-devel

qt4-mac-devel will take a long time to build. So you may want to install the
Trolltech binary package instead.

Linux
-----
	sudo apt-get install qt4-dev pkg-config libsamplerate libfftw3f libmad

The configure process also requires lsb_release on Linux. This is usually 
already installed (correct me if I'm wrong).

Windows
-------
Best of luck to you.


Using liblastfm
===============
The demos directory shows some basic usage.

You need an API key from http://last.fm/api.

Radio
-----
Please set an identifiable UserAgent on your HTTP requests for the actual MP3s,
in extreme cases we'll contact you directly and demand you do so :P

HTTP & Networking
-----------------
You can specify your own QNetworkAccessManager derived class for liblastfm to 
use with WsRequestBuilder::setNetworkAccessManager(). Our default is pretty good
though, auto-determining proxy settings on Windows and OS X for instance.


Development
===========
Public Headers
--------------
1. Header guards should be prefixed with LASTFM, eg. LASTFM_WS_REPLY_H
2. #includes should be to the system path eg. #include <lastfm/Scrobbler>
3. Don't make a header public unless it is absolutely required!
4. To make the header public edit the headers.files line in the pro file

Private Headers
---------------
1. For consistency and to make it more obvious it is a private header, don't
   prefix the header guard with LASTFM
2. #includes should be the full source tree path, eg.
   #include "../ws/WsReply.h"
