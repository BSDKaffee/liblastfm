Dependencies
============
The build process requires ruby, perl and GNU make. Pls to remove perl dep.
Pls to fork http://github.com/mxcl/liblastfm

Mac OS X
--------
	sudo port selfupdate
	sudo port upgrade installed
	sudo port install libsamplerate fftw-3 libmad

Linux
-----
	sudo apt-get install qt4-dev pkg-config libsamplerate libfftw3f libmad

The configure process also requires lsb_release on Linux. This is usually 
already installed (correct me if I'm wrong).

Windows
-------
Best of luck to you.


Development
===========
Public Headers
--------------
1. Header guards should be prefixed with LASTFM, eg. LASTFM_WS_REPLY_H
2. #includes should be to the system path eg. #include <lastfm/Scrobbler>
3. Don't make a header public unless it is absolutely required!
4. To make the header public edit the headers.files line in the pro file

Private Headers
---------------
1. For consistency and to make it more obvious it is a private header, don't
   prefix the header guard with LASTFM
2. #includes should be the full source tree path, eg.
   #include "../ws/WsReply.h"
